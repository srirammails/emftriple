In addition to revolutionizing search technology, we use our world-class programming skills to innovate in a number of other areas as well. Our projects include working on advanced information-retrieval algorithms, massive scalability and storage solutions, and large-scale applications that enrich the user experience. We also work extensively on networking systems, advertising systems and complex transaction systems in consumer applications.

The role: Software Engineer

As a Software Engineer, you have a penchant for solving complex and interesting problems. Google is much more than search, and our mission has much greater scope. To handle information at the scale of the web requires ideas from just about every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, user interface design, etc.

You will work on many projects that carry varying responsibilities. Below are some examples of the diverse projects with which you might be involved.

              """As a Software Engineer working on Google's critical production applications and infrastructure, your mission will be to ensure Google is always fast, available, scalable and engineered to withstand unparalleled demand. You will be in the thick of solving the [often unexpected] problems of systems at scale in a way most engineers never experience. Your scope is from the kernel level to the continent level. This position requires the flexibility and aptitude to zoom in to fine-grained detail, and the agility to zoom right back out and up the stack. Delve into how software performs, packets flow, and hardware and code interact, in support of managing services, steering global traffic and predicting and preventing failures.... all in a day's work. 

You will design and develop systems to run Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Wave, Maps, Voice, AppEngine, and more. You'll manage, automate, and make data-based decisions and judgment calls which influence globally distributed applications. You'll own the production services which comprise *.google.com, and critical infrastructure like GFS, BigTable, MapReduce and large-scale 'cloud computing' clusters.

You will also be driving performance and reliability from software and infrastructure at massive scale -- where dealing in petabytes and gigabits and shifting by orders of magnitude is routine. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and work with just about every other engineering and operations team at Google. You will be looked upon as an expert and advocate to fellow engineers on making design and reliability trade-offs in running large-scale services and engineering complex systems that fail gracefully and transparently to users.

The most successful candidates for this role will have strong analytical and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding and systems design, solid communication skills and a desire to tackle the complex problems of scale which are uniquely Google. We are particularly interested in software engineers familiar with aspects of running web services at scale -- depth in either networking technologies and Unix system calls are strong pluses."""^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> ;
